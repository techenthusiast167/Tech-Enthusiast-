# Hi, I’m D4rk_Intel 

### Cybersecurity | OSINT & Threat Intelligence Researcher  

I’m a passionate and results-driven cybersecurity professional specialising in Open Source Intelligence (OSINT), threat intelligence and proactive cybersecurity tooling. My Github landscape reflects deep exploration across reconnaissance, intelligence-gathering, automation and dark-web research.

---

## What I Do  

- Lead and execute OSINT investigations — analyzing digital footprints, tracking threat actors, and uncovering exploitable patterns.
  
- Build open-source tools to automate reconnaissance, metadata extraction, dark web crawling, and phishing awareness.
  
- Collaborate with cybersecurity communities to share insights, contribute to toolsets, and assist organizations in hardening their posture.
  
- Continuously learn and adapt — from social-media intelligence techniques to darknet infrastructure mapping and advanced reconnaissance methodologies.

## Why My Work Matters  

In the rapidly evolving cybersecurity landscape:  

- Organisations increasingly face threats from exposed infrastructure, poor reconnaissance hygiene, and social-engineered vectors.
  
- Threat Intelligence and OSINT is no longer just an academic exercise — it’s a first line of defence and proactive intelligence mechanism.
  
- By building and sharing tools, I **enable communities** to detect, analyse and mitigate threats before they become breaches.
